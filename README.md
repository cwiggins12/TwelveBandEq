As the title states, this is a 12 band eq with a lot of versatility and quite optimized compared to some other much more feature rich eqs. This has the ability to make up to 12 eqs of various types, a pre/post spectrum analyser, and pre and post make-up gains. 
The planned additions can be found in the todo list file at the top of the repo directory.

Below is a video with a brief description of how everything can be used.

Happy mixing! :)
